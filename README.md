# Hello there 👋🏻

My name is Marcin, very nice to meet you. In the following repository you can find implementation of the task.

### How to run

In root directory of the project execute `docker compose up --build`. All required `.env` files are already defined
in `docker-compose`

Initial import can take some time but after that only new orders will be processed.
